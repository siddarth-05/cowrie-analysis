Working with Cowrie
Using a tool called 'Cowrie' - a Medium interaction Secure Shell Honeypot [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie), and also made a basic python script to look for intruders.
A honeypot server mimics a real device but actually tracks the incoming attackers.
 *What this does*
-Deploys Cowrie honeypot on a virtual Ubuntu server.
- Logs attacker behavior on fake SSH/Telnet shell.
- Parses and summarizes Cowrie logs:
  - Most common IPs
  - Usernames attempted
  - Commands executed
I think that's pretty neat.
 *Tech Used*
- Ubuntu VM
- Python 3
- Cowrie Honeypot
- Bash/ Linux Terminal
