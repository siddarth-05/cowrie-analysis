# What do I do?
1) Clone cowrie. Go to your terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git`
2) Set a VM up. There's tons of tutorials online. You don't have to know all the ins and outs. I used Oracle's VirtualBox and Ubuntu on my VM.
3) I used a virtual environment to run mine - this is optional; you'll still ultimately have to run bin/cowrie start
4) You should be seeing a fake shell at this point. Run some commands. Make some files. You can even change up stuff in your Cowrie directory to make the fake shell look real by adding pretend files
5) Once you're done, exit.
6) Navigate to the cowrie logs and run the script, along with whatever arguments you want to find attackers details

# What I learned
1) Deploying honeypots for offensive testing and threat research
2) Working with linux based systems and virtual environment tools
3) Writing Python tools to parse raw Log data
4) Understanding Attacker behavior from an SSH honeypot server
